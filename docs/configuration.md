# Configuration

supacrawl runs with no configuration out of the box. When you do want to change a default — pin a browser engine, set your locale, throttle search — there is one typed settings model, one local store, and a clear precedence order. The same model emits a machine-readable schema so a separate control-plane GUI can render a settings form and tune supacrawl without touching the CLI.

## Precedence

Settings resolve in three layers, each overriding the one before:

1. **Built-in defaults** — sensible values baked into the model.
2. **The stored file** — `~/.supacrawl/config.toml` (override the location with `SUPACRAWL_CONFIG_PATH`). Human-readable TOML; only values that differ from the default are written, so the file stays small.
3. **Environment variables** — `SUPACRAWL_<NAME>` (e.g. `SUPACRAWL_TIMEOUT`, `SUPACRAWL_ENGINE`). An environment variable always wins over the stored file.

On top of all three, a **per-command flag** (`supacrawl scrape --engine camoufox`) overrides the standing baseline for that one invocation.

```text
default  <  stored file  <  environment  <  per-command flag
```

## Managing settings from the CLI

```bash
supacrawl config get                 # effective values (environment applied)
supacrawl config get --stored        # only the file + defaults, env ignored
supacrawl config get engine          # a single value
supacrawl config set engine camoufox # persist a default to the store
supacrawl config unset engine        # revert to the default
supacrawl config path                # where the store lives
```

`config set` validates the value against the field's type and range before writing, so a bad value is rejected at the point of entry rather than at scrape time.

## Runtime adoption status

The settings schema, the store, and the `config` CLI are complete. Runtime consumption is being adopted incrementally: the **`strategy_memory`, `metrics`, and `metrics_full_url`** settings are read from the resolved config (store + environment) on every CLI and MCP run today. The remaining knobs (browser, anti-bot, search, locale, cache) are exposed in the schema and persisted in the store for a control-plane GUI; their adoption into each command's option resolution is rolling out. Until then, set those via their environment variables or per-command flags.

## Settings

Every setting is a standing default; a per-request flag or API argument still overrides it. Grouped as the GUI renders them:

| Group | Setting | Env var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| browser | `timeout` | `SUPACRAWL_TIMEOUT` | `30000` | Page load timeout (ms), 1000–300000. |
| browser | `headless` | `SUPACRAWL_HEADLESS` | `true` | Run without a visible window. |
| browser | `wait_until` | `SUPACRAWL_WAIT_UNTIL` | `domcontentloaded` | `domcontentloaded` / `load` / `networkidle`. |
| browser | `user_agent` | `SUPACRAWL_USER_AGENT` | _(engine default)_ | Override the User-Agent string. |
| browser | _(env only)_ | `SUPACRAWL_DISABLE_DEV_SHM` | _(auto: on in a container)_ | Pass `--disable-dev-shm-usage` to Chromium so it uses disk instead of the container's small `/dev/shm`, avoiding crashes on heavy pages. Auto-detected inside a container; set `1`/`0` to force on/off. Chromium engines only (playwright/patchright); Camoufox is Firefox. |
| browser | _(env only)_ | `SUPACRAWL_BROWSER_CLOSE_TIMEOUT` | `3` | Seconds to allow a graceful browser close before the driver reaps the process instead. Teardown happens after the content is already extracted, and Chromium's own close regularly stalls on a page with live connections until an internal 30s timeout releases it — pure dead time on the caller's clock. Raise it for a politer close; `0` reaps immediately. |
| locale | `locale` | `SUPACRAWL_LOCALE` | `en-US` | Maps to Accept-Language. |
| locale | `timezone` | `SUPACRAWL_TIMEZONE` | `UTC` | e.g. `Australia/Brisbane`. |
| anti_bot | `engine` | `SUPACRAWL_ENGINE` | _(auto)_ | `playwright` / `patchright` / `camoufox`. Leave unset to auto-escalate. |
| anti_bot | `stealth` | `SUPACRAWL_STEALTH` | `false` | Start with Patchright. Usually unnecessary. |
| anti_bot | `escalate` | `SUPACRAWL_ESCALATE` | `true` | Auto-climb the engine/stealth ladder on a poor result. |
| anti_bot | `solve_captcha` | `SUPACRAWL_SOLVE_CAPTCHA` | `false` | Needs a CAPTCHA API key; each solve costs money. |
| anti_bot | _(env only)_ | `SUPACRAWL_CAPTCHA_FAIL_FAST` | `true` | Stop after one attempt on a bare CAPTCHA wall instead of walking the whole engine ladder — a stronger engine does not solve a CAPTCHA, so the three further escalations are wasted (#153). A CAPTCHA inside a CDN managed-challenge interstitial (Cloudflare "just a moment") is a `bot_challenge`, not a `captcha`, and still escalates. Set `0` to restore the full-ladder walk. |
| content | `only_main_content` | `SUPACRAWL_ONLY_MAIN_CONTENT` | `true` | Strip nav/header/footer. |
| search | `search_providers` | `SUPACRAWL_SEARCH_PROVIDERS` | _(none)_ | Ordered fallback chain, e.g. `brave,tavily,serper`. |
| search | `search_provider` | `SUPACRAWL_SEARCH_PROVIDER` | `brave` | Legacy single provider. |
| search | `search_rate_limit` | `SUPACRAWL_SEARCH_RATE_LIMIT` | _(provider default)_ | Requests per second. |
| search | — | `SUPACRAWL_SEARCH_STRICT_PROVIDERS` | `false` | Refuse the built-in DuckDuckGo fallback: a configured provider that cannot be used fails loudly instead of quietly leaving via a provider you did not choose. |
| search | — | `SUPACRAWL_SEARCH_PUBLIC_FALLBACK` | `false` | Opt in to a DuckDuckGo fallback behind a backend that FAILS AT RUNTIME (e.g. SearXNG engines down). Off by default so a self-hosted backend's failure surfaces as a loud error rather than a query silently leaving in-house; `STRICT_PROVIDERS` overrides it. |
| memory | `strategy_memory` | `SUPACRAWL_STRATEGY_MEMORY` | `true` | Per-domain strategy learning. |
| telemetry | `metrics` | `SUPACRAWL_METRICS` | `true` | Record one quality/usage event per scrape/search. |
| telemetry | `metrics_full_url` | `SUPACRAWL_METRICS_FULL_URL` | `false` | Log full URLs, not just the domain. Off for privacy. |
| cache | `cache_dir` | `SUPACRAWL_CACHE_DIR` | _(default location)_ | Where cached content lives. |

## Secrets

Credentials are **environment-only**. They are never written to the store and never appear in the GUI schema — a dashboard can see _whether_ each is set, never its value.

```bash
supacrawl config secrets   # presence only, never the value
```

Honoured: `CAPTCHA_API_KEY`, `BRAVE_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `SERPER_API_KEY`, `SERPAPI_API_KEY`, `EXA_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and `SUPACRAWL_PROXY` (a proxy URL can carry credentials).

`SEARXNG_URL` is a clean instance URL with no credentials embedded (e.g. `https://searxng.example.invalid`); when the instance sits behind an HTTP Basic-auth gate, pair it with `SEARXNG_USERNAME` and `SEARXNG_PASSWORD`, whose presence is reported alongside the keys above. `SEARXNG_URL` itself is ordinary configuration rather than a credential, so it is not listed there. Embedding a credential directly in `SEARXNG_URL` (`https://user:pass@host`) still works as a deprecated fallback, but turns the whole URL into a secret, so prefer the discrete username/password pair.

The MCP server can skip the environment entirely: set `SEARXNG_PORTCULLIS_CREDENTIAL` to the catalogue name of a [Portcullis](https://github.com/radar-hooves/portcullis) credential carrying `username` and `password` fields, and the pair is fetched from the broker in-process at startup — the credential never becomes an environment variable, a rendered config value, or a file on the host. A fetched pair beats `SEARXNG_USERNAME` / `SEARXNG_PASSWORD`, which in turn beat any userinfo left in `SEARXNG_URL`. Unset (the default) means no fetch and no change in behaviour, so the CLI and the REST API are unaffected. When the broker cannot produce a usable credential the server starts degraded and search fails loudly, rather than falling through to a search engine nobody configured.

When a self-hosted SearXNG's own engines go down under load, every query comes back empty. When SearXNG _names_ the failed engines (reports them as unresponsive) supacrawl surfaces a loud error naming them (not a silent `[]`), because for a backend chosen to keep queries in-house, quietly routing them to a public engine is a privacy failure rather than a degradation. `SUPACRAWL_SEARCH_PUBLIC_FALLBACK=1` opts into a DuckDuckGo fallback for exactly that case — degraded-but-answering search, at the cost of that query leaving in-house. Worth knowing before deciding: if your SearXNG already lists DuckDuckGo among its own engines, enabling the fallback introduces **no new third-party recipient** — the same host already sees the query; the fallback only bypasses SearXNG's aggregation for it. `SUPACRAWL_SEARCH_STRICT_PROVIDERS=1` overrides the opt-in back to fail-loudly.

A quieter failure exists: SearXNG's upstream engines get CAPTCHA-walled and return _nothing_ while SearXNG itself answers HTTP 200 with an empty set and names no unresponsive engine — indistinguishable, on a single query, from a genuine no-match. supacrawl handles it without ever turning a real no-match into an error: an empty answer from one provider lets the chain try the next **configured** provider (never an unconfigured public engine unless `PUBLIC_FALLBACK` is on), an unbroken run of empty answers degrades that provider's health (`consecutive_empty` climbs; a query with matches clears it), and — once a full window of caller searches has come back empty in a row — every search response carries `all_recent_empty: true`. That last flag is what lets a caller tell "no matches" from "the backend has stopped answering" off the response itself, without polling `supacrawl_health`. An all-configured-providers-empty result stays `success: true` with `data: []`: a query with nothing to find is a real outcome, not a failure.

## Telemetry over OTLP

supacrawl always writes telemetry to the local `events.jsonl` (the durable record). Each event is **also** emitted as one structured log record on the `supacrawl.telemetry` logger, so a standard log/trace collector can pick it up without supacrawl pushing to any log store's own API or holding a credential for one.

Every entry point (the CLI, `supacrawl serve`, and `supacrawl-mcp`) configures its logging once at startup from the standard OpenTelemetry environment:

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://collector.example.invalid   # ship over OTLP
```

Set it and log records (this telemetry included) ship to that collector. Leave it unset and records go to stdout (stderr for `supacrawl-mcp`, whose stdout is the stdio protocol channel) as JSON lines carrying `timestamp`, `level`, `service_name`, `service_version`, `message`, `logger`, and the event's own fields (`domain`, `verdict`, `score`, `latency_ms`, ...) — filter on `message` (`scrape` or `search`) or any field.

Privacy carries over from the local sink: only what `events.jsonl` contains is logged — domain-only unless you opt into `metrics_full_url`.

## The settings schema (for a GUI)

`supacrawl config schema` emits the JSON schema of the settings model. Each field carries `x-ui` render metadata so a control-plane dashboard can build a settings form directly from it:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "timeout": {
      "type": "integer",
      "default": 30000,
      "minimum": 1000,
      "maximum": 300000,
      "x-ui": {
        "group": "browser",
        "order": 10,
        "widget": "slider",
        "help": "How long to wait for a page to load..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `x-ui` keys are `group`, `order`, `widget`, `help`, and an optional `visible_when` (conditional visibility, e.g. `metrics_full_url` is shown only when `metrics` is on). A GUI reads the schema for layout, reads and writes values through the same store the CLI uses, and reads `config secrets` for credential presence. The CLI emits; a GUI consumes — they share one source of truth.

## Control plane and the UI seam

supacrawl is the control plane; a UI is a separate plane that plugs into it — the engine ships no front-end of its own, the way a coordination server (e.g. Headscale) exposes an API and CLI while its web UIs live in separate projects. The seam has two halves:

- **Settings** — the typed config store, the `x-ui` schema, and the `config` CLI. A UI renders the schema, reads/writes values through the store, and checks credential presence via `config secrets`.
- **Telemetry** — the local `events.jsonl` (read with `MetricsReader` / `metrics summary`) and, over OTLP, whatever collector `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` names (see [Telemetry over OTLP](#telemetry-over-otlp)).

When `supacrawl serve` is running, the settings and telemetry state are also exposed read-only over HTTP, so a front-end can plug in without shelling out to the CLI:

| Endpoint                                | Returns                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /supacrawl/config/schema`          | the `x-ui` settings schema, to render a form                              |
| `GET /supacrawl/config`                 | effective non-secret values plus a secret **presence** map (never values) |
| `GET /supacrawl/metrics/summary?days=N` | the telemetry rollup, without parsing the raw JSONL                       |

Writes still go through the store, and credentials stay environment-only, so these read endpoints never expose a secret. For live dashboards a UI reads the OTLP collector directly; for a local control panel it reads these endpoints. Either way supacrawl provides the seam and stays UI-agnostic.
