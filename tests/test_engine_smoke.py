"""#145 — CI smoke-test that each stealth engine actually launches headless.

The deliverable is the launch check itself. Each engine (playwright / patchright
Chromium, camoufox Firefox) is launched headless against a trivial loopback page;
if an engine cannot launch — package missing, browser binary not fetched, version
skew — the test FAILS. This is what makes the #144 no-launch availability report
trustworthy rather than a confident liar: something independently proves that an
engine reported "available" can in fact start.

Marked ``stealth_smoke`` and excluded from the main test job, because it needs
every engine's browser binary fetched (``camoufox fetch`` especially, which the
main job does not run). A dedicated CI job installs the stealth+camoufox extras,
fetches all browsers, and runs ``pytest -m stealth_smoke`` — a red here gates the
merge, catching a broken stealth engine in supacrawl's own pipeline instead of
downstream at a consumer's container build.

To confirm it can go RED (not merely green today): temporarily point an engine at
a missing binary, e.g.
    PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/nonexistent uv run pytest -m stealth_smoke
and observe the Chromium engines fail to launch.
