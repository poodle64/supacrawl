"""Tests for benchmark/reference.py — hydration-settle strategy.

Verifies that the reference renderer's content-stabilisation wait captures
content injected by inline JavaScript after the initial navigation event,
rather than returning a pre-hydration shell.

All tests are offline: content is injected via Playwright's ``set_content``
method rather than a network request, so no HTTP server is required.
