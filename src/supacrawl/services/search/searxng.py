"""SearXNG search provider implementation.

SearXNG is a free, self-hosted metasearch engine. It aggregates results
from multiple search engines without tracking users.

Configuration:
    SEARXNG_URL       Instance URL, carrying no credentials.
                      Example: SEARXNG_URL=https://searxng.example.invalid
    SEARXNG_USERNAME  HTTP Basic username, when the instance sits behind a
                      Basic-auth gate. Optional — an ungated instance needs
                      neither this nor SEARXNG_PASSWORD.
    SEARXNG_PASSWORD  HTTP Basic password. Optional, paired with the above.

Deprecated: embedding the credential in the URL as ``https://user:pass@host``.
That shape makes the whole URL a secret, which is a materially worse property
than it looks: any config renderer that resolves ``${SEARXNG_URL}`` prints the
password wherever it renders, and httpx quotes the request URL verbatim into
its own error messages, so a single 401 puts the password in the logs. The
shape is still honoured so an installation configured that way keeps working,
but the credential is split out of the URL at construction — the URL that
reaches the wire, the logs, and any error message never carries userinfo.
Prefer SEARXNG_USERNAME / SEARXNG_PASSWORD, which win when both are set.
