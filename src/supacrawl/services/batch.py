"""Shared concurrent batch scrape service.

Provides ``run_batch_scrape`` — a reusable async function that scrapes a list of
URLs concurrently using a single shared browser and a semaphore to cap parallelism.

Used by both the CLI ``batch`` command and the API ``/v1/batch/scrape`` endpoint so
the concurrency and retry logic live in exactly one place.

    Accepts either an already-constructed ``scrape_service`` (caller owns the
    browser lifecycle) or creates its own ``BrowserManager`` internally.  The
    semaphore limits how many scrapes are in-flight at the same time.

    Args:
        urls: Ordered list of URLs to scrape.
        browser: Optional shared ``BrowserManager``.  When provided, the
            ``scrape_service`` argument is also expected; neither is closed on
            return.
        scrape_service: Optional ``ScrapeService`` backed by ``browser``.
            Created internally when not provided.
        formats: Output formats (default: ``["markdown"]``).
        only_main_content: Extract main content area only.
        timeout: Per-page load timeout in milliseconds.
        max_age: Cache freshness in seconds (``0`` = no cache).
        concurrency: Maximum number of concurrent in-flight scrapes.
        retry: Maximum per-URL retry attempts on failure (``1`` = one try, no
            retries; ``2`` = one retry, etc.).
        continue_on_error: When ``False``, the first URL failure aborts the
            remaining work and raises ``RuntimeError``.
        headers: Custom HTTP headers forwarded to every scrape call.
        proxy: Proxy URL forwarded to the ``BrowserManager`` when it is
            created internally.
        engine: Browser engine override forwarded to the ``BrowserManager``
            when it is created internally.
        stealth: Enable stealth mode when creating an internal browser.
        cache_dir: Cache directory forwarded to the ``ScrapeService`` when it
            is created internally.
        locale_config: Optional ``LocaleConfig`` forwarded to the service.
        strategy_store: Optional per-domain strategy memory (#130) forwarded to
            an internally-created ``ScrapeService`` so each URL seeds and updates
            its domain's learned strategy. Ignored when ``scrape_service`` is
            supplied (the caller's service carries its own).
        telemetry: Optional field telemetry sink (#137) forwarded to an
            internally-created ``ScrapeService`` so per-URL quality/usage is
            recorded.
        scrape_kwargs: Extra keyword arguments forwarded verbatim to
            ``ScrapeService.scrape`` for every URL (e.g. ``wait_for``,
            ``include_tags``, ``exclude_tags``, ``actions``).  These override
            the per-call defaults built from the explicit arguments, letting the
            API surface forward its full v2 scrape-option set.
        cancelled: Optional ``asyncio.Event``.  When set, in-flight slots
            drain cleanly and no new URLs are dispatched.

        ``BatchScrapeResult`` with per-URL outcomes and aggregate counts.
