"""Outbound URL safety guard (SSRF hardening, #152).

Supacrawl fetches whatever URL a caller — or a page it has already fetched —
hands it: scrape/crawl/map targets, PDF downloads, sitemap and robots.txt
lookups, search-result metadata probes. None of that previously checked
whether the target resolves to an internal address, so a hostname pointing at
cloud instance metadata (``169.254.169.254``) or a link-local address was
fetched without complaint, and a redirect could pivot to one mid-request.

Two failure modes are closed here:

1. **No resolved-address check at all.** A URL whose hostname resolves to a
   blocked range is refused. Checking IP literals in the URL is not enough —
   owning a DNS record that resolves to the metadata endpoint defeats that.
2. **No pinning, so a time-of-check/time-of-use gap.** Even with a check, a
   hostname validated as public could rebind to an internal address before
   the connection is made, unless the validated address is what gets
   connected to. :func:`resolve_and_pin` closes that window for the httpx
   fast path; :func:`guarded_request` / :func:`guarded_stream` are the call
   sites that actually connect to the pinned address.

Redirects get the same treatment per hop via :func:`guarded_request` /
:func:`guarded_stream`: a 3xx pivot to an internal address is the same attack
wearing a hat.

**Residual exposure — the browser engines (Playwright/Patchright/Camoufox).**
Those engines own their own network stack; there is no supported API to hand
Chromium or Firefox a pre-resolved literal address while it still presents
the original hostname for TLS SNI and virtual hosting the way httpx's
``extensions={"sni_hostname": ...}`` does. The browser call sites
(``BrowserManager.fetch_page`` / ``extract_links``,
``ScrapeService._scrape_with_captcha_solving``) call :func:`resolve_and_pin`
as a pre-flight — refusing a URL that resolves to a blocked address right
now — but the browser then re-resolves the hostname itself when it actually
connects, so a DNS answer that changes in that window is not pinned. This is
a real, accepted gap: closing it would mean routing all browser traffic
through a local proxy that itself pins addresses, which is out of scope
here. Documented rather than silently left open, per the household's "an
honest 'this path cannot be pinned, here is why' is a legitimate outcome"
standard.

RFC 1918 private ranges and loopback are **not** blocked by default:
operators legitimately point supacrawl at internal documentation sites,
which is a first-class use case for a self-hosted tool. A consumer that
accepts untrusted URLs (a multi-user app letting users add their own
sources) needs the stricter posture and can set
``SUPACRAWL_BLOCK_PRIVATE_NETWORKS=1`` to refuse internal targets outright.
This mirrors ragify's ``RAGIFY_BLOCK_PRIVATE_NETWORKS`` switch (see
poodle64/ragify's ``url_guard.py``) so the two libraries agree on the same
policy shape. The guard is a policy layer, not a network firewall; operators
who need guaranteed SSRF containment should also use network egress
controls.
