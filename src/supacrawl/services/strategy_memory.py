"""Per-domain strategy memory — supacrawl remembers what worked (#130).

A stateless crawler re-derives the right engine/wait/stealth for a domain on
every hit. supacrawl is local-first, so it can remember: the first example-airline.com
scrape that succeeds with ``camoufox + ~5s wait`` seeds the next one there,
short-circuiting the escalation ladder. Over weeks of field use the defaults
quietly become excellent for the exact sites the user visits — the moat a
stateless hosted crawler cannot match.

Design (validated against the satisficing-bandit literature):
- A **cost-aware champion** per registrable domain: the cheapest strategy whose
  exponential moving-average quality stays above the bar. Engine cost order is
  playwright (0) < patchright/stealth (1) < camoufox (2).
- **Epsilon-greedy downward exploration**: occasionally probe a cheaper strategy
  so a site that drops its defences is re-learned at lower cost, not retried
  forever on an expensive one.
- **Hard-block crash**: if the champion strategy is itself blocked, evict it
  immediately (non-stationarity — the site changed) and re-learn.
- **TTL decay**: a champion older than the TTL is forgotten so stale strategies
  expire rather than being trusted indefinitely.

The store is a single small JSON file under ``~/.supacrawl/strategies/`` (the
same zero-infrastructure area as the cache). It is entirely optional: with an
empty or disabled store, behaviour is identical to the stateless ladder.
