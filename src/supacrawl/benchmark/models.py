"""Data contracts for the scrape-quality benchmark.

Two families of model live here:

- **Corpus** (``BenchCase``, ``BenchSuite``) — the input: a curated, annotated
  list of test sites loaded from a YAML manifest.
- **Results** (``CaseMetrics``, ``CaseResult``, ``RunAggregate``, ``RunResult``)
  — the output: per-case scores and a run-level aggregate, persisted to disk in
  a versioned, dashboard-ingestible shape.

``SCHEMA_VERSION`` is stamped on every persisted run so that a downstream
dashboard can evolve its reader as the result shape changes.

        url: The page to scrape.
        category: Broad challenge family (e.g. ``static``, ``spa``, ``pdf``).

        why: One-line rationale for inclusion.
        js_heavy: True when meaningful content only appears after JavaScript.
        spa: True when the page is a single-page application.
        antibot: True when the target deploys bot defences.
        content_type: ``html`` or ``pdf``; selects the comparison path.
        difficulty: Curator's 1 (trivial) to 5 (brutal) estimate.
        probes: Capability tags exercised (e.g. ``js_render``, ``tables``).
        stable: True when the URL's content is frozen enough for valid
            run-over-run comparison. Unstable targets (live anti-bot, paywalls)
            are capability probes, not regression signal.
        scored: True when the case contributes to the composite regression
            index. Defaults to ``stable`` when not set explicitly.
        expect: Substrings that good output SHOULD contain (gold anchors).
