"""Persistence and comparison layer for benchmark run results.

Writes run results to a flat file layout under a base directory:

- ``runs/<run_id>.json``    — full ``RunResult`` verbatim.
- ``metrics.jsonl``         — one flat row per case per run (dashboard-ingestible).
- ``index.jsonl``           — one row per run (headline numbers for trend views).

The JSONL files use the tidy long-form format: every row is self-contained so a
dashboard can ingest incrementally without reprocessing old runs.
